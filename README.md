This was a project that three of us did at BYU to demonstrate how a hidden Markov model with multivariate Gaussian emission models could be used to transcribe handwriting in U.S. Census records.  

Just remember this was a class project, though we did write up a paper ... though it looks like I need to find the final PDF to put in the repo. :slightly_smiling_face:

And also be aware that my class mate who was supposed to write up the Viterbi algorithm (which is a fast dynamic programming algorithm) may have used a simpler brute force search instead. I have since rewritten the Viterbi algorithm for another project, but I don't think I incorporated it into this code.  I will try to do so when necessary.
